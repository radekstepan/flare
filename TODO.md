fix:
- https://github.com/arethetypeswrong/arethetypeswrong.github.io/blob/main/docs/problems/CJSResolvesToESM.md

extras:
- share a URL with the input to playground
- Netlify badge
- GitHub Actions CI
- darkmode ala Dark Reader

think about:
- how to share a set of values across different gates? (in JS it is easy, but YAML refs are ugly)
